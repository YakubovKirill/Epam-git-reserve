Two hearts, one valve
Pumping the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Sticking it out, letting you down
Making it right

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Change will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die
